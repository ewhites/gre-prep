# Day 1

I completed everything in my planned list; went great and I feel a lot more comfortable with strategies / common questions / question types on both quantitative and verbal sections.

---

# Day 2

Ran through all of the practice sets for quantitative reasoning in the official guide. I make lots of careless mistakes, and my errors are usually from standard deviation / probability distributions as well as interior angles / non-right triangle problems. I finished up the day by taking the Kaplan Free GRE; got a 167/158 (LOTS of improvement from my initial 162/151!)
