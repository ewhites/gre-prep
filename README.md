# Day 1

Today, I have the following objectives:
* Study 5 hours for quantitative (Chapters 1-3, Practice Sets 1-2 in Quantitative Reasoning book)
* Study 3 hours for verbal reasoning (Chapter 3, Chapter 4 Sets 1-3 in Official Guide, Videos + Vocab)
* Two videos from GRE Ninja's "Verbal Reasoning" playlist (2/6)
* Four videos from GRE Ninja's "Quantitative Reasoning" playlist (4/20)
* Create a vocabulary deck of at least 50 words, copying the "357 Best GRE Vocab" list by PrepScholar.

Note that these hours include reviewing the practice test answers I got wrong last night. I will be doing the following schedule

* QR: 11:00 AM - 1:00 PM: Reviewing test, Chapter 1, 2 in QR book, 2 videos
* QR: 1:30 PM - 3:30 PM: Finishing up Chapters 2, 3 in QR, Practice Set 1, 1 video
* VR: 4:00 PM - 5:30 PM: Two videos + Chapter 3, Vocab 
* QR: 6:00 PM - 7:00 PM: Practice Set 2, 1 video
* VR: 7:30 PM - 9:00 PM: Vocab Review, Chapter 4 Sets 1-3, More Vocab 

After all of this, I plan to get some other homework / interview skill assessments done.

QR Block 1: I finished reviewing the practice test. It seems I need to review equilateral triangle / iscoscoles triangle definitions as well as prepare better for data interpretation. I also need to refresh myself on probaility distributions / "n choose r" problems. I finished two videos of the quant series and chapters 1 and 2 in the QR book. I'll take a 35 minute break now since I ended 5 minutes earlier than I was expecting.
